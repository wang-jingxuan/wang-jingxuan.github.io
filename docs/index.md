### **Education & Experience**

I grew up in **Beijing** and studied at **Tsinghua University** (undergraduate) and the **University of Hong Kong** (Master). Through my studies and internships, I've explored finance, biomedical engineering, and I’m always curious about how data shapes decision-making. ([View my CV](CV/CV_Jingxuan_Wang.pdf))

### **Fun Facts**

- I love **spicy food**—the kind makes you question your life choices but keeps you coming back for more.
- I once volunteered at the **Beijing Winter Olympics**, which was a great excuse of wearing like a snowball.
- I have a habit of trying **new Milk Tea shops** but always end up ordering the same thing.
